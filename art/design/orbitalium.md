One orbit for fungi, easy edible. Could keep it to A4 and produce a mini-foldaway of it. The fewer species, the more illustratable it becomes. to monochrome, and then render on tote?

One orbit for berries - not an issue if it's small , could well be done on A5 . Illustrations, and then render to monochrome and put on mug
