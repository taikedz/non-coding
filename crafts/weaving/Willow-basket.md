    * Using fresh bramble vines, need gloves and something to scour it with during harvest
* Make it Primitive - tall basket <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cs1djWABuQ>
    * No voice, just going over the stuff we know already, but with an oval base

Willow seems to be the most pliable. Drying+soaking is optional

From the Trug video, importance of looking up how to make a Gods Eye to add ribs ; as well as a note on tempering (beinding it before using it)

From the bramble video, importance of having an odd number of spokes once we've started the main under/over

Tall basket essentially shows the use of an oval base and tall sides

Greencraft suggests of course using harder types like dogwood and thick willow as a frame, and bramble as the weaving. Showing also reinforced hoop, probably what GreatAlt did for th trug.
